Million Ohms Project Software
Jack Christensen
V1.1 Oct-2011

The source files included here are suitable for use with WinAVR.  Hex files for ATtiny45 and ATtiny85 are also included.  This project can also be built using the Arduino IDE along with the Arduino Tiny core at http://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/.

To use Arduino Tiny, create a new sketch folder under the Arduino sketchbook folder, and name it millionOhms.  Copy millionOhms.cpp, button.cpp, and button.h into the new folder (only these three files are necessary when using Arduino Tiny).  Rename millionOhms.cpp to millionOhms.pde, then the sketch can be opened with the Arduino IDE.  From the Tools > Board menu, select ATtiny45 @ 1MHz or ATtiny85 @ 1MHz.
