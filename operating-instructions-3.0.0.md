## Introduction

Amuse your friends and confuse your enemies! Keep the uninitiated away from your workbench or desk and out of your lab!

- Great conversation piece or gag gift
- Big, scary 1,000,000 Î© resistor in the middle of the board
- [ATtiny85 microcontroller](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85)
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)-compatible, hackable open-source hardware and software
- Can be (re)programmed with an [ICSP programmer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/46)

## Operation

Four LEDs flash in 8 different patterns and 3 speeds.

There are four operating modes:

1. **Slow random mode:** Flashes the LEDs using a random pattern and speed for 16 seconds, then sleeps for a random interval between 10 and 30 minutes.
2. **Fast random mode:** Like slow random mode but sleeps for between 5 and 15 minutes.
3. **Demo mode:** Like the random modes, but flashes the LEDs for 4 seconds and sleeps for 8 seconds.
4. **Manual mode:** Flashes the LEDs for three minutes, then sleeps until the select button is pressed. Pressing the select button while the LEDs are flashing selects the next speed/pattern. Holding the select button while the LEDs are flashing puts the circuit back to sleep.

To choose the operating mode, press the RESET and SELECT buttons together; first release RESET, then release SELECT. The current mode is indicated on the LEDs with the upper left LED being mode 1 (slow random). Press and release SELECT to choose the mode. Hold SELECT to save the mode and start the LEDs flashing, or just wait for five seconds and the mode will be saved.

The SELECT button has no effect in demo mode or in the random modes.

Pressing and releasing the RESET button will cause the program to restart in the last saved mode. The mode is remembered even if the batteries are removed.

With two new AA alkaline cells, battery life should be over a year in
slow random mode, over six months in fast random mode, and (SWAG) a couple weeks in demo mode.
